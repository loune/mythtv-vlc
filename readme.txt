VLC MythTV access plugin Version 0.5 (for windows)
==================================================
by Loune Lam 28/11/2010

To install it, just extract the zip and move libaccess_myth_plugin.dll to your VLC/plugins directory. Once you've installed the plugin, you can now open URLs that start with myth://

Be sure to set your mythbackend URL in the VLC preferences for the Media Browser to work.

This was tested to be working with VLC 1.1.5 and MythTV 0.23.1.
